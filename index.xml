      <description>My copy of the post on the Red Hat OpenShift Blog.
In this post I will show you how to use Roles published to Ansible Galaxy as an Operator to manage an application in Kubernetes. Reusing a Role in this way provides an example of how to create an Operator that simply installs an application with the flexibility to expand and customize the behavior organically as requirements dictate.
I will leverage both the Ansible Operator and the k8s module to demonstrate how you can use Ansible to create Kubernetes native applications.</description>

      <description>I am excited to maintain a blog and there seems no better way to get things rolling than to document the start. When I started playing with Hugo and thinking about how I would integrate it with Personal GitHub Pages, I assumed it would be a trivial operation. Turns out there are a few gotchas worth documenting. This post will simply cover creating a static website using Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Website Generator and making it work with Personal GitHub Pages.</description>
